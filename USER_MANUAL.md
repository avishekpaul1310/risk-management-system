   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of the risk
   - **Category**: Select from Technical, Financial, Operational, Legal
   - **Owner**: Person responsible for monitoring this risk

### Risk Assessment Guidelines

#### Traditional Scoring
- **Low Impact (1)**: Minor delays, small cost increases
- **Medium Impact (2)**: Moderate delays, significant cost increases
- **High Impact (3)**: Major delays, substantial cost increases

#### Monte Carlo Cost Estimation
- **Be Realistic**: Base estimates on historical data when possible
- **Consider Range**: Ensure pessimistic is significantly higher than optimistic
- **Validate Logic**: Optimistic ‚â§ Most Likely ‚â§ Pessimistic
- **Include All Costs**: Direct costs, indirect costs, opportunity costs

## üé≤ Monte Carlo Simulation

### Understanding Monte Carlo Simulation

**What it does**: Runs thousands of "what-if" scenarios to understand the range of possible total cost impacts from all project risks.

**Why it's valuable**: Instead of getting a single number, you get a probability distribution showing the likelihood of different cost outcomes.

### Running a Simulation

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure all risks have Monte Carlo parameters filled in
2. **Access**: Project detail page ‚Üí "Monte Carlo Simulation"
3. **Set Parameters**:
   - **Number of Simulations**: 5,000 is recommended (more = more accurate, but slower)
4. **Run**: Click "Run Simulation"
5. **Wait**: Processing may take 10-30 seconds depending on complexity

### Interpreting Results

#### Key Statistics

- **Mean Cost**: Average total cost across all simulations
- **Median Cost**: Middle value when all results are sorted
- **90th Percentile**: 90% of simulations had costs below this amount
- **95th Percentile**: 95% of simulations had costs below this amount
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of cost variability

#### Using the Results

**For Budget Planning**:
- Use **90th Percentile** for contingency reserves
- This means 90% chance actual costs will be below this amount

**For Decision Making**:
- Compare **mean cost** vs. project budget
- If 90th percentile exceeds available budget, consider risk mitigation

**For Stakeholder Communication**:
- Show the **histogram** to illustrate cost uncertainty
- Explain that this represents thousands of possible scenarios

#### The Histogram Chart

- **X-axis**: Total cost ranges
- **Y-axis**: Number of simulations that fell in each range
- **Shape**: 
  - Normal distribution = balanced risk profile
  - Right-skewed = potential for high-cost outliers
  - Left-skewed = most scenarios are higher cost

### Simulation Best Practices

1. **Validate Inputs**: Ensure all cost estimates are realistic
2. **Regular Updates**: Re-run simulations as risks change
3. **Compare Scenarios**: Run simulations before/after mitigation
4. **Document Assumptions**: Note what estimates are based on

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

**Q: How often should I update risks?**
A: Review and update risks at least weekly for active projects, or whenever project circumstances change significantly.

**Q: What if I don't have good cost estimates?**
A: Start with rough estimates and refine them over time. It's better to have approximate estimates than none at all.

**Q: Can I delete risks?**
A: Yes, but consider changing status to "Closed" instead to maintain historical records.

### Monte Carlo Simulation

**Q: How many simulations should I run?**
A: 5,000 is usually sufficient for accurate results. You can use fewer (1,000) for quick analysis or more (10,000) for maximum precision.

**Q: What if my results seem unrealistic?**
A: Check your cost estimates and likelihood percentages. Ensure they're based on realistic scenarios and historical data.

**Q: Should I use the mean or 90th percentile for budgeting?**
A: Use the 90th percentile for contingency planning - this gives you 90% confidence that costs won't exceed this amount.

### Technical Issues

**Q: The simulation is taking too long**
A: Try reducing the number of simulations or check if you have many risks with very large cost ranges.

**Q: I can't see the Monte Carlo fields**
A: Make sure you're using the updated risk forms and that the database migrations have been applied.

**Q: The chart isn't displaying**
A: Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser and try refreshing the page.
