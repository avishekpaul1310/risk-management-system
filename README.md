## üé≤ Monte Carlo Simulation

### What is Monte Carlo Simulation?

Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful statistical technique that uses random sampling to solve complex problems. In risk management, it helps answer the crucial question: **"What's the probable range of total cost impact from all project risks?"**

### How It Works (Non-Technical Explanation)

1. **Input Your Estimates**: For each risk, provide three cost estimates:
   - **Best Case**: If everything goes well
   - **Most Likely**: What you realistically expect
   - **Worst Case**: If things go badly

2. **Simulation Process**: The computer runs thousands of "what-if" scenarios:
   - Randomly determines if each risk occurs (based on probability)
   - If a risk occurs, randomly picks a cost within your estimate range
   - Adds up all costs for that scenario
   - Repeats this process 5,000+ times

3. **Results**: You get a complete picture of possible outcomes:
   - **Average cost**: Most likely total impact
   - **90th Percentile**: "There's a 90% chance costs will be less than this amount"
   - **Distribution Chart**: Shows the full range of possibilities

### Business Benefits

- **Better Budgeting**: Set realistic contingency reserves
