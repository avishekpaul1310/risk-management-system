2. **Generate** comprehensive scoring suggestions
3. **Display** results in an interactive modal window

### 3. Understanding the Results

The AI analysis provides:

#### Suggested Scores Section
- **Likelihood Score** (1-3) with percentage range
- **Impact Score** (1-3) with severity level
- **Overall Risk Assessment** with score, level, and priority

#### Analysis & Reasoning Section
- **Likelihood Reasoning**: Why this likelihood score was suggested
- **Impact Reasoning**: Detailed impact analysis
- **Assessment Summary**: Overall risk evaluation

#### Detailed Tabs
- **Key Factors**: Critical elements affecting the risk
- **Monitoring**: What to watch for and how often
- **Immediate Actions**: Steps to take right away

### 4. Applying Suggestions

After reviewing the AI analysis:

1. **Review** the suggested scores and reasoning
2. **Consider** the key factors and monitoring indicators
3. **Click "Apply AI Suggestions"** to use the recommended scores
4. **Modify** if needed based on your specific context
5. **Save** the risk with the updated scores

## AI Scoring Methodology

### Likelihood Assessment (1-3 Scale)

The AI evaluates likelihood based on:

- **Low (1)**: 0-33% probability within project timeframe
  - Rare occurrence in similar contexts
  - Strong preventive measures in place
  - Historical data shows infrequent occurrence

- **Medium (2)**: 34-66% probability within project timeframe
  - Moderate chance based on industry patterns
  - Some risk factors present
  - Mixed historical precedents

- **High (3)**: 67-100% probability within project timeframe
  - Strong indicators suggest likely occurrence
  - Multiple risk factors present
  - Historical data shows frequent occurrence

### Impact Assessment (1-3 Scale)

The AI evaluates impact considering:

- **Low (1)**: Minor impact (<10% effect on objectives)
  - Minimal disruption to timeline or budget
  - Easy to recover from
  - Limited scope of effect

- **Medium (2)**: Moderate impact (10-25% effect on objectives)
  - Noticeable but manageable disruption
  - Requires significant effort to address
  - Multiple areas affected

- **High (3)**: Major impact (>25% effect on objectives)
  - Severe disruption to project success
  - Difficult and costly to recover from
  - Wide-ranging consequences

### Overall Risk Calculation

- **Risk Score**: Likelihood Ã— Impact (1-9 scale)
- **Risk Level**: Low (1-2), Medium (3-4), High (6-9)
- **Priority Ranking**: Critical, High, Medium, Low

## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Quality Input
- **Detailed Descriptions**: More context leads to better suggestions
- **Specific Information**: Include relevant technical, financial, or operational details
- **Clear Titles**: Use descriptive risk titles that capture the essence

### 2. Review AI Suggestions Critically
- **Consider Your Context**: AI suggestions are starting points, not absolute truth
- **Apply Domain Knowledge**: Your expertise matters in final decisions
- **Adjust as Needed**: Modify suggestions based on specific circumstances

### 3. Use Monitoring Indicators
- **Implement Tracking**: Set up monitoring for suggested indicators
- **Regular Reviews**: Check indicators at recommended frequencies
- **Early Warning**: Use thresholds for proactive risk management

### 4. Document Decisions
- **Reasoning**: Note why you accepted or modified AI suggestions
- **Context**: Record specific factors that influenced your decision
- **Updates**: Keep assessments current as project conditions change

## Integration with Existing Features
